# TERRAFORM CI/CD

![alt text]()

&nbsp; &nbsp; Terraform is an infrastructure as code **(IAC)** Contious Deployment Stack other than Cloud Formation Template **(CFT)**. Terraform, 
differs than **CFT** because it is cloud/platform agnostic **IAC** tool.

&nbsp; &nbsp; This time we are going to provide solution for creating **Postgres Cluster** using **Terraform** and **Ansible**. Therefore, we are not going to use **managed
PostGres** from AWS.
